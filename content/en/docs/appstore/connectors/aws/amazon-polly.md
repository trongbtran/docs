## 1 Introduction

The [Amazon Polly](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/205068) connector enables you to connect your app to [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) and easily convert written text into human voice in your web applications.

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Amazon Polly allows you to synthesize text to speech, with 96 voices supporting 34 languages. With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages, use Amazon Polly to build speech-activated applications, for example, to accommodate the following use cases:

* Provide accessibility features for users who have difficulty reading
* Create audio-supported interfaces in your application.

### 1.2 Prerequisites

The Amazon Polly Connector requires the [AWS authentication connector version 2.1 or higher](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333) to authenticate with Amazon Web Services (AWS). for more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication Connector see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).

### 1.3 Dependencies

* AWS Authentication Connector
* Mendix Studio Pro 9.18.0

## 2 Installation

Follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/) to import the Amazon Polly connector into your app.

## 3 Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonPollyConnector** section. The connector provides a domain model and activities that you can use to connect your app to Amazon Polly. Each activity can be implemented using it in a microflow or nanoflow.

For example, to synthesize a string of text into speech, implement the [SynthesizeSpeech](#synthesize-speech) activity by performing the following steps:

1. In the **App Explorer**, right-click on the name of your module, and then click **Add microflow**.
2. Enter a name for your microflow, for example, *ACT_SynthesizeSpeech*, and then click **OK**.
3. In the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonPollyConnector** section, find the **SynthesizeSpeech** activity.
4. Drag the **SynthesizeSpeech** activity onto the work are of your microflow.
5. Double-click the **SynthesizeSpeech** activity to configure the required parameters. 
    
    For the `SynthesizeSpeech` activity, you must add your own entity that inherits from `System.FileDocument` to store the contents of the audio in and specify the AWS Region. You must then add your `SynthesizeSpeechRequest` entity in your microflow as the last parameter. This entity requires the following parameters:

    * `OutputFormat` - MP3, OGG_VORBIS, or PCM. JSON is not yet supported by the connector.
    * `SampleRate` - The valid values for MP3 and OGG_VORBIS are *8000*, *16000*, *22050*, and *24000*. The valid values for PCM are *8000* and *16000*.
    * `VoiceID` - The selected voice for the output of the text.
    * `Text` - The actual string of text that needs to be translated.
6. In the **Edit parameters** section, edit the **AWS_Region** parameter, and provide a value by using a variable or an expression. For a list of available AWS regions, see [AWS_Region](#aws-region).
7. Click **OK**.
8. Open a page that contains a widget for playing audio, for example, the [Play Audio](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120804) widget.
9. Configure the widget to use the `FileDocument` configured in the **SynthesizeSpeech** activity.
10. Configure a method to trigger the `ACT_SynthesizeSpeech` activity. 
    For example, you can associate the activity with a custom button on a page in your app. For an example of how this can be implemented, see [Creating a Custom Save Button with a Microflow](/refguide/creating-a-custom-save-button/).

To help you work with the Amazon Translate connector, the following sections of this document list the available entities, constants, activities, and enumerations that you can use in your application.

### 3.1 Constants

Constants are used to define configuration values. All activities are exported as microflow activities that can directly be added to a microflow. Make sure the constants are configured correctly as shown in the table below, so the connector can authenticate the request with AWS.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.AWS_ClientCertificateID` | The ID for the `ClientCertificate` used to sign the authentication requests. For more information, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/). |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.ProfileARN` | The `ProfileARN` for the [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) profile that has access to the Amazon Polly service |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.Region` | The region in which both the IAM Roles Anywhere and the Polly service are located |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.RoleARN` | The `RoleARN` of the IAM Role that has access to the Polly service. |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.AWS_TrustAnchorARN` | The `TrustAnchorARN` of the TrustAnchor configured in IAM Roles Anywhere that is used for the configured role |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.UseStaticCredentials` | The `UseStaticCredentials` Boolean value defines if the connector uses the provided static credentials (`AccessKey` and `SecretKey`) over the session-based credentials |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.AccessKey` | The `AccessKey` from an AWS account able to use this service |
| `AmazonPollyConnector.SecretKey` | The `SecretKey` from an AWS Account able to use this service |

### 3.2 Domain Model

The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. For more information, see [Domain Model](/refguide/domain-model/).

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Voice` | The Voice entity is a representation of an Amazon Polly voice. It contains the unique identifier for a voice (`VoiceID`) that is required for `SynthesizeSpeech` activities. It also contains additional information on a voice like the name, language and gender. |

### 3.3 Enumerations

An enumeration is a predefined list of values that an be used as an attribute type.

#### 3.3.1 `OutputFormat`

The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For audio streams, this must be MP3, OGG_VORBIS, or PCM. JSON is currently not supported.

| Name | Caption |
| --- | --- |
| MP3        | MP3        |
| OGG_VORBIS | OGG_VORBIS |
| PCM        | PCM        |

#### 3.3.2 `Engine`

Specifies the engines (standard or neural) that are supported by a given voice.

| Name | Caption |
| --- | --- |
| Standard | standard |
| Neural | neural |

#### 3.3.3 `TextType`

| Name | Caption |
| --- | --- |
| PlainText | PlainText |

### 3.4 Activities

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow.

#### 3.4.1 Synthesize Speech {#synthesize-speech}

The `SynthesizeSpeech` activity allows you to synthesize a string of text into an audio file. It requires a `SynthesizeSpeechRequest` entity containing the required information, and a `TargetFileDocument` (`System.FileDocument` or its specialization) to contain the response of the `SynthesizeSpeech` activity. It also requires the `AWS_Region` in which the Polly service should be called.

The `SynthesizeSpeech` activity has no return value, instead the input parameter TargetFileDocument will contain the synthesized speech.

#### 3.4.2 DescribeVoices

The `DescribeVoices` activity returns the list of voices from the Amazon Polly service. It requires an `AWS_Region` parameter to get the list of supported voices from the given AWS region.
The voices can be used in the `Synthesize Speech` activity to synthesize a piece of text to speech with the right voice. 

The `DescribeVoices` activity returns a `DescribeVoicesResponse` entity containing a list of `DescribeVoice` entities.
